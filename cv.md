## About me

All my life, I’ve spent time at the computer. And I always wanted to work on a computer. Learn new technologies and use them. I think programming is the best choice. I tried web development and loved it. I decided to study JavaScript as a language. I studied on my own for several months and now it’s time to go deeper. I decided to take courses from the RS school.
